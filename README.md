# Welcome

This Github repository contains source code for my website, [kishorecmg.herokuapp.com](https://kishorecmg.herokuapp.com).

Please note that this source code is not how the project is deployed.

# Introduction

There are several languages and frameworks involved in this website production. They are,
  - HTML, CSS and JavaScript
  - React JS
  - Node JS

I thought that creating a React app with Node JS backend would be easy, but it was proved wrong, and I never thought web development would be this challenging.

Some one on the internet once told,

> In Programming, time spent is actually in,
> 70% of thinking
> 25% of error handling and
> 5% is the actual typing.

And I *guess* and I *realized* that this is not wrong.

### Usage rights

Um, there is nothing constraining you from copying this code. Actually, I will be happy if this one is actually helpful to someone.


### How to use the source code to create your own website?

*Some knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React JS and Node JS is required beyond this*

Install NPM package manager from [here](https://www.npmjs.com). Node JS would be automatically downloaded along with Node Package Manager. NPM is a amazing JavaScript library that has almost everything that would suit our needs. 

Start by installing Express in a seperate folder

```sh
npm install express
```

Install React JS library in a seperate folder

```sh
npm install create-react-app
```
After creating the react app and node js server, use
```
npm run build
```
in create-react-app folder. Copy the contents of the **build** folder to the folder where Node JS is installed. Then 

```
node index
```

should do the trick.

For someone who wants to know from where I learnt React JS and Node JS, here are some *noice* websites and YouTube websites that might be helpful for you as well.

* [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ/videos)
* [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com)
* And lastly, [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com)

Scrimba is an amazing website for learning front-end easily, and this website is really innovative, that you could pause video and directly type your code!
